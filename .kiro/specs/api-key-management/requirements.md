# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KeyHaven Pro is an intelligent API key management platform designed to solve the critical security and workflow challenges that developers face when managing API keys across multiple services. The platform provides secure storage, automated monitoring, intelligent rotation, and AI-driven insights to transform API key management from a security liability into a seamless, secure asset. Targeting solo developers, indie hackers, and small teams, KeyHaven Pro reduces breach risks by 80%+ while saving hours per week through automation and intelligent workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely store my API keys with client-side encryption, so that my sensitive credentials are protected from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt the key using AES-256 client-side encryption before storage
2. WHEN a user accesses their stored keys THEN the system SHALL decrypt keys client-side using their authenticated session
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing key access
4. IF encryption fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent key storage
5. WHEN keys are stored THEN the system SHALL never store plaintext keys on the server

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to manage team access to API keys with role-based permissions, so that I can control who can view, edit, or rotate specific keys while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a team owner invites a member THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of specific role permissions (view, edit, rotate, admin)
2. WHEN a team member attempts to access a key THEN the system SHALL verify their role permissions before granting access
3. WHEN permissions are changed THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce the new access levels
4. IF a user lacks permission THEN the system SHALL display an access denied message
5. WHEN a team member is removed THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke all their access to team keys

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want automated monitoring and rotation of my API keys, so that I can proactively prevent security issues without manual oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a key is added THEN the system SHALL allow setting up automated rotation schedules (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)
2. WHEN usage anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts via email using Resend integration
3. WHEN a rotation schedule triggers THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate the key and update connected services
4. IF rotation fails THEN the system SHALL alert the user and provide manual rotation options
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the key and notify the user

    ### Requirement 4

    **User Story:** As a developer managing multiple projects, I want a comprehensive analytics dashboard, so that I can visualize key usage patterns, health scores, and security insights across all my services.

    #### Acceptance Criteria

    1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key health scores based on usage patterns and security metrics
    2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show usage charts, rotation history, and risk assessments
    3. WHEN security risks are identified THEN the system SHALL display color-coded risk levels (green/low, yellow/medium, red/high)
    4. IF CVE data indicates vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL highlight affected keys and suggest actions
    5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable analytics data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple services, I want seamless integrations with popular platforms, so that I can manage billing, receive notifications, and inject keys into my deployment workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user upgrades to premium THEN the system SHALL process payments securely through Stripe integration
2. WHEN notifications are triggered THEN the system SHALL send emails via Resend with relevant key information
3. WHEN deploying to GitHub THEN the system SHALL securely inject keys into repository secrets
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN connecting services THEN the system SHALL validate API credentials before storing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer who prefers natural language interactions, I want AI-powered insights and queries, so that I can quickly find information and get intelligent recommendations about my API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a natural language query THEN the system SHALL interpret and execute the request (e.g., "Show expiring keys")
2. WHEN analyzing key patterns THEN the system SHALL provide AI-generated insights and recommendations
3. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL explain the risk in plain language with suggested actions
4. IF a query cannot be understood THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions for rephrasing
5. WHEN providing insights THEN the system SHALL cite data sources and confidence levels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working across different environments, I want a responsive web interface with optional browser extension, so that I can manage keys efficiently from any device or directly from service dashboards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web app THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN using the browser extension THEN the system SHALL allow importing keys directly from service dashboards
3. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and feedback within 2 seconds
4. IF the interface is inaccessible THEN the system SHALL provide WCAG-compliant alternatives (keyboard navigation, alt text)
5. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality and data synchronization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer concerned about vendor lock-in, I want an open-source solution with data export capabilities, so that I can maintain control over my data and contribute to the platform's development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform is released THEN the system SHALL be available under an OSI-approved license (MIT)
2. WHEN a user wants to export data THEN the system SHALL provide secure export functionality for all their keys and metadata
3. WHEN contributing to development THEN the system SHALL accept community contributions through standard open-source workflows
4. IF users want to self-host THEN the system SHALL provide clear deployment documentation and scripts
5. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL support import/export formats compatible with other key management tools

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer building applications rapidly, I want quick onboarding and intuitive key management, so that I can focus on coding rather than learning complex security tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user signs up THEN the system SHALL complete onboarding within 3 clicks (email/GitHub OAuth)
2. WHEN adding keys THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop uploads and auto-categorization by service
3. WHEN performing common actions THEN the system SHALL provide one-click operations (rotate, export, share)
4. IF a user needs help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual tooltips and guided tutorials
5. WHEN managing multiple keys THEN the system SHALL provide bulk operations and filtering capabilities

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer working with sensitive data, I want comprehensive audit logging and compliance features, so that I can track all key-related activities and meet security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any key operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp, user, and operation details
2. WHEN viewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, filterable access to all historical activities
3. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL generate audit reports in standard formats
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL create detailed incident logs with context
5. WHEN data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete logs according to configured schedules
